 * Traits kind of look a lot like Interfaces. Both Traits and interfaces are usually 
 * simple, concise and not much use without an actual implemented class. However the 
 * difference between the two is important. An interface is a contract that says 
 * “this object is able to do this thing”, whereas a Trait is giving the object the 
 * ability to do the thing.
