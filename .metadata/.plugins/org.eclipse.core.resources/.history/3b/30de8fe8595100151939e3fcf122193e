 * One of the problems of PHP as a programming language is the fact 
 * that you can only have single inheritance. This means a class can 
 * only inherit from one other class. However, a lot of the time it 
 * would be beneficial to inherit from multiple classes. For example, 
 * it might be desirable to inherit methods from a couple of different 
 * classes in order to prevent code duplication. This problem can lead 
 * to class that has a long family history of inheritance which often 
 * does not make sense.
